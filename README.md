# NLP and Video Summarization with Transformers

## üìò Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python and Transformer-based AI models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and video content summarization. It includes two interactive Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Transformers.ipynb**
   - Showcases the use of Transformer models for NLP tasks.
   - Likely tasks include:
     - Text classification
     - Text summarization
     - Question answering
     - Language generation
   - Uses libraries such as Hugging Face‚Äôs `transformers` and `torch`.

2. **summarizing_video_to_text.ipynb**
   - Extracts audio from a video file.
   - Converts speech audio into text using speech recognition models.
   - Applies NLP techniques to summarize the extracted text.
   - Useful for creating automatic summaries of lectures, interviews, or meetings.
